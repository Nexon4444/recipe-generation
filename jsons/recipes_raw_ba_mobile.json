The trickiest part of this recipe is removing the chicken bones, but you can watch the process in our video below. If you don\u2019t want to get your hands messy (we get it), ask your butcher to remove the bones from four chicken thighs, leaving the skin intact. Position the skin-on, boneless thighs close to each other in the pan so that each brick sits on top of two pieces while they cook.",

        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Wrap 2 bricks with foil (if you don\u2019t have any bricks lying around, use a heavy skillet). Working with 1 leg at a time, place chicken skin side down on a cutting board. Using your fingers, feel for the thigh bone, which runs from one end of the thigh to the other. Using a boning knife or another thin sharp knife, cut straight down into flesh until the tip of the knife hits the bone, then slice from one end of bone to the other to expose its entire length. Using short strokes and trying to stay as close to the bone as possible, cut meat away from bone on both sides, working your way around until you can wiggle the tip of your knife underneath it (take care not to cut through the skin). With the front end of your blade underneath the bone, slice upward toward free end of bone to release flesh. At this point, the bone should only be attached at the joint that connects it to the drumstick.",
            "Repeat this process, this time making a cut from the top of the drumstick bone (at the joint) down to foot end. Cut along either side of drumstick bone (same as you did with the thigh bone) until you can wiggle your knife underneath. With the blade angled toward the cutting board this time, cut meat away from bone. By now, the drumstick and thigh bones should be attached only where they meet at the joint. Make small cuts all around and underneath joint until you can cut out bones completely. Cut away any pieces of cartilage that remain. Turn deboned chicken over and smooth skin over meat. (Freeze bones and use at a later date for stock.)",
            "Season chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Pour oil into a medium cast-iron skillet. Place chicken in pan skin side down (it\u2019s okay if the pieces touch, but make sure they don\u2019t overlap). Heat pan over medium-high and place a prepared brick on top of each piece (or, place a sheet of foil over chicken, then set a second cast-iron skillet on top). Cook chicken, checking halfway through to make sure skin isn\u2019t taking on color too quickly and reducing heat to medium if needed, until skin is deep golden brown and crisp and flesh is almost completely cooked through, about 10 minutes."

And if you've ever been hesitant to roast a whole bird at home, this one's for you\u2014it's converted many a nervous meat cooker. We've developed a recipe that eliminates one of the most common complaints about this classic dish: that it\u2019s hard to know when they\u2019re cooked all the way through. We\u2019ve made it easier to check for doneness with lots of visual cues that anyone can follow, but if you have an instant-read thermometer, you can feel free to use it; just remove the chicken from the oven when thickest part of thigh hits 160\u00b0, and carryover cooking will bring it up to 165\u00b0. Consider this chicken, a hunk of good baguette, and a simple green salad your Sunday afternoon plan from now on.",

A 3\u20134-lb. chicken is pretty much the ideal size for roasting this way. Something a little bit bigger will work, but once you get much past 4\u00bd-lbs. it becomes harder to guarantee that the breast meat won't dry out in the time it takes the dark meat to cook. Pat the whole thing dry with paper towels. It's super important to get the chicken as dry as possible, which helps with browning.",
            "With chicken breast facing up and legs pointing toward you, use a sharp knife to slice through loose area of skin connecting the leg and breast, making about a 3\"-long incision. Continue cutting downward until you hit the joint that connects the thigh to the body, then stop (once you get through the skin, there\u2019s not much there; if you are cutting through flesh, you\u2019re too close to the breast). This exposes the leg joint, making it easy to tell if chicken is cooked. Repeat on second side.",
            "Season every surface of chicken, including skin along backbone, inside cavity, under wings, and inside part of the leg you just exposed, with lots of salt and pepper. If you\u2019re using kosher salt, it should take you 4\u20135 generous\u2014as in, four finger\u2014pinches, which will be around 4 whole teaspoons.",

            "Drizzle chicken all over with melted butter (mmmmmmm) and transfer to oven.",
            "Roast until chicken is nicely browned and cooked through, checking for doneness after 45 minutes. To check, carefully remove skillet from oven (the handle is hot!), poke a knife into leg joints, and pierce the meat. If juices run clear, the chicken is done. If you see a rosy pink color, it needs more time. Continue to roast, checking every 5 minutes, until juices run clear. (If you\u2019re not sure, you can also use the knife to lightly shred some of the meat along the thigh bone\u2014the meat should look opaque and the fibers should separate easily.)",
            "Let chicken rest in skillet at least 15 minutes before carving\u2014this will help the juices in the meat to settle, and will also get it down to a temperature that is cool enough to handle with your bare hands while carving. Don't worry: It's a big piece of meat, so it will still be plenty warm by the time you serve it. Transfer chicken to a platter. Pour all of those glorious, buttery pan juices over top of the meat and serve with roasted lemon and garlic alongside. Winner, winner, chicken dinner!NERVOUS ABOUT CARVING THE BIRD? THIS VIDEO SHOULD HELP.",

The \u201cmother\u201d may not be visible in the vinegar (it will resemble a small jellyfish), but the raw vinegar should trigger a new fermentation once mixed with new wine. This should help grow a new visible mother as well as a pellicle (a thin layer of cellulose that acts as a barrier between the air and the vinegar while it ferments). Transferring the mother, along with a layer of the pellicle, will both work to quickly start new fermentations in the future.",

Along the way it might smell sort of weird, skunky, or maybe like nail polish remover as ours did for days on end. Don\u2019t give up, just keep going. When your vinegar tastes as sharply acidic as your store-bought stuff does, you are ready to bottle it.",

You can continue to age it in the bottle where its aroma and flavor should continue to improve.
